# Rustacene
A simple neuroevolution simulator written in Rust using Bevy engine\

### Features

* Graph-based neural network architecture inspired by NEAT genetic algorithm
* Bit-flipping mutation mechanism allowing for a more realistic artificial evolution
* Energy-based system being both the evolutionary pressure and the population control mechanism
* Memory efficient gene structure
* Simple speciation system based on genetic distance
* Color-coding for different species

### Controls

* WASD to move the camera
* Mouse wheel to zoom in and out
* Space to pause the simulation
* R to reset the simulation
* 1, 2, 3 to select the simulation speed
